                    Ratan Naval Tata (born 28 December 1937) is an Indian industrialist, philanthropist and former chairman of Tata Sons. 
                    He was a chairman of the Tata Group from 1990 to 2012, and interim chairman from October 2016 through February 2017. 
                    He continues to head its charitable trusts. In 2008, he received the Padma Vibhushan, the second highest civilian 
                    honour in India, after receiving the Padma Bhushan, the third highest civilian honour in 2000.
                </p>
                <p class="detail-paragraph">
                    He is the son of Naval Tata, who was adopted by Ratanji Tata, son of Jamsetji Tata, the founder of the Tata Group. 
                    He graduated from the Cornell University College of Architecture with a bachelor's degree in architecture.He joined 
                    Tata in 1961, where he worked on the shop floor of Tata Steel. He later succeeded J. R. D. Tata as chairman of Tata 
                    Sons upon the latter's retirement in 1991. Under his tenure the Tata Group acquired Tetley, Jaguar Land Rover, and 
                    Corus, in an attempt to turn Tata from a largely India-centric group into a global business. Tata is also one of the 
                    largest philanthropists in the world, having donated around 60â€“65% of his income to charity.

                    Ratan Tata is also a prolific investor and has made numerous investments in several startups. Tata has invested in over

                Ratan Tata was born in Bombay, now Mumbai, during the British Raj, into a Parsi Zoroastrian family, on 28 December 1937.
                He is the son of Naval Tata, who was born in Surat and later adopted into the Tata family, and Sooni Tata, the niece of 
                Tata group founder Jamsetji Tata. Tata's biological grandfather, Hormusji Tata, was a member of the Tata family by blood. 
                In 1948, when Tata was 10, his parents separated, and he was subsequently raised and adopted by Navajbai Tata, his grandmother 
                and widow of Ratanji Tata. He has a younger brother Jimmy Tata and a half-brother, Noel Tata, from Naval Tata's second 
                marriage with Simone Tata, with whom he was raised.
            </p>
            <p>
                Tata studied at the Campion School, Mumbai till the 8th class. After which, he studied at the Cathedral and John Connon School 
                in Mumbai, the Bishop Cotton School in Shimla, and the Riverdale Country School in New York City, which he graduated from in 
                1955. After graduating from high school, Tata enrolled in Cornell University, from which he graduated with a bachelor's degree 
                in architecture in 1959. In 2008, Tata gifted Cornell $50 Million, becoming the largest international donor in the university's 
                history.

        <div class="career-paragraph paragraph">
            <p>
                In the 1970s, Ratan Tata took on a managerial role within the Tata Group and initially found success by revitalizing National 
                Radio and Electronics (NELCO), only to see it decline during an economic downturn. In 1991, he succeeded J.R.D. Tata as chairman 
                of Tata Sons, where he faced resistance from subsidiary heads accustomed to significant operational freedom. To centralize control, 
                Tata implemented policies such as a retirement age, direct reporting to the group office, and profit contributions for brand-building. 
                He emphasized innovation and entrusted responsibilities to younger talent, streamlining operations and exiting non-core businesses to 
                focus on globalization.
            </p>
            <p>
                During his 21-year tenure, Tata Group's revenues and profits multiplied significantly, transforming from commodity sales to 
                branded products. Major acquisitions like Tetley, Jaguar Land Rover, and Corus repositioned Tata as a global entity, with over 
                65% of revenues coming from international operations. Tata also spearheaded the development of the Tata Nano car, making cars 
                affordable for the average Indian consumer, and advanced India's electric vehicle initiative with the Tigor Electric Vehicles.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ratan Tata retired from his executive role on 28 December 2012, leading to a leadership crisis marked by the controversial 
                appointment and subsequent removal of Cyrus Mistry as chairman. Tata returned as interim chairman before Natarajan Chandrasekaran 
                was appointed in February 2017. Legal battles ensued, with India's Supreme Court eventually upholding Mistry's dismissal.
            </p>
            <p>
                Beyond his corporate role, Tata has invested in numerous companies using his personal wealth. His investments include Snapdeal, 
                Teabox, CashKaro.com, Ola Cabs, Xiaomi, Nestaway, and Dogspot. Additionally, he launched Goodfellows, a companionship startup 
                for senior citizens, promoting intergenerational friendships.

            <p>
                Tata Group is renowned for its extensive philanthropic efforts in education, medicine, and rural development, making significant 
                contributions both in India and globally. One prominent example is their support for the University of New South Wales, where they 
                aided in the development of capacitive deionization technology to provide better water solutions for challenged areas. Additionally, 
                Tata Group's substantial $70 million donation to the University of California, San Diego (UC San Diego) led to the establishment of 
                the Tata Institute for Genetics and Society, housed within Tata Hall. This state-of-the-art facility, opened in 2018, focuses on 
                research in genetics and disease control, fostering collaboration and innovation among researchers.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the realm of education, Tata Group has made notable endowments to prestigious institutions. At Cornell University, the Tata 
                Education and Development Trust established a $28 million scholarship fund to support Indian undergraduate students, ensuring 
                that financial constraints do not hinder access to top-tier education. Harvard Business School also benefited from Tata Group's 
                generosity with a $50 million donation for the construction of Tata Hall, an executive center for mid-career education programs. 
                Similarly, the Tata Innovation Center at Cornell Tech, named after Ratan Tata, serves as a business incubator, blending academic 
                and industry spaces to foster entrepreneurial ventures.
            </p>
            <p>
                Tata Group's commitment to technological advancement is evident in their support for Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), where a $35 
                million donation funded TCS Hall, dedicated to research in cognitive systems and autonomous vehicles. In India, the Tata Center 
                for Technology and Design at the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay, was established with a â‚¹950 million endowment, focusing 
                on developing engineering solutions for communities with limited resources. Furthermore, the Tata Trusts provided â‚¹750 million to 
                the Indian Institute of Science for neuroscience research aimed at understanding and treating Alzheimer's disease. Internationally, 
                the MIT Tata Center of Technology and Design was created at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) to address challenges 
                faced by resource-constrained communities, with an initial focus on India.
